# n8n-Workflows

This repository contains n8n workflow templates that use the **Google Gemini Chat Model** and the **AI Agent** node for various automation tasks.
The workflows are saved as `.json` files and can be easily imported into your n8n instance.

## Workflows

### **1. MAIL-REPLY.json (Gmail AI Auto-Reply Agent)**

This workflow is a simple AI agent designed to trigger on new emails, generate a reply, and then send it using the Gmail node.
* **Trigger:** **Gmail Trigger** (on new email)
* **Core Logic:** **AI Agent** node using the **Google Gemini Chat Model** and the **Send a message in Gmail** tool.
* **Purpose:** Automatically draft or send replies to incoming emails based on the AI's logic.

### **2. Telegram event booking.json (Telegram Calendar Booking Agent)**

This workflow acts as a Telegram bot that can book events in Google Calendar based on conversational input from a user.
* **Trigger:** **Telegram Trigger** (on new message)
* **Core Logic:** **AI Agent** node using the **Google Gemini Chat Model**, **Simple Memory** for conversation history, and the **Create an event in Google Calendar** tool.
* **Purpose:** Allows users to interact with a Telegram bot to schedule events in their Google Calendar.

### **3. ü§ñ RAG Chatbot using n8n (AI Agent + OpenAI + Pinecone)**

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** built entirely using **n8n**, a no-code workflow automation tool.  
It uses **OpenAI embeddings**, **Pinecone vector storage**, and the **AI Agent** node to let users upload documents and chat with them intelligently.

## üß© Workflow Overview

The workflow integrates multiple nodes to implement a full RAG pipeline:
1. **Upload File** ‚Üí Accepts user documents (PDF, text, etc.)
2. **Download File** ‚Üí Fetches the uploaded file for processing
3. **Recursive Character Text Splitter** ‚Üí Splits text into small, manageable chunks
4. **Default Data Loader** ‚Üí Loads document content into the workflow
5. **OpenAI Embeddings** ‚Üí Generates vector embeddings for each text chunk
6. **Pinecone Vector Store** ‚Üí Stores embeddings for semantic similarity search
7. **When Chat Message Received** ‚Üí Trigger for user input messages
8. **OpenAI Chat Model** ‚Üí Generates responses using retrieved context
9. **AI Agent** ‚Üí Combines retrieval and generation to answer context-aware questions


## üß† Concept: What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines two key AI techniques:
- **Retrieval:** Fetching the most relevant text chunks from stored documents using vector similarity.
- **Generation:** Using a language model (like GPT) to generate responses using those retrieved chunks.
This approach ensures the chatbot‚Äôs answers are **accurate**, **contextual**, and **grounded in your own data**.
